# Minimal Ledger Node  
## Concept Document

---

## What This Model Explains

This model demonstrates:

- Responsibility boundaries  
- Deterministic behavior  
- Failure containment  
- Integrity-first design  
- Minimal authority  

It shows how infrastructure can remain predictable and auditable.

---

## What This Model Intentionally Ignores

The following areas are outside the scope of this model:

- Consensus mechanisms  
- Peer-to-peer communication  
- Incentive systems  
- Governance models  
- Distributed coordination  
- Performance optimization  
- Replication strategies  

These concerns belong to broader system architecture.

## What I Chose NOT To Design

The following were intentionally excluded to preserve conceptual clarity:

- Conflict resolution logic  
- Automatic recovery or self-healing  
- Data replication  
- Leader election  
- Network discovery  
- Business rule enforcement  
- Adaptive or intelligent behavior  

The node remains deliberately limited.

## Design Philosophy

When correctness is threatened, reduce capability — do not improvise.

The node is:

- Deterministic  
- Predictable  
- Transparent in behavior  
- Strict in integrity preservation  
- Minimal in scope  

Its value comes from discipline, not complexity.
